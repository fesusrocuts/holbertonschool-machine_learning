"""2. Convolution with Padding
function convolve grayscale padding
images is a numpy.ndarray with shape (m, h, w) containing multiple grayscale
images
m is the number of images
h is the height in pixels of the images
w is the width in pixels of the images
kernel is a numpy.ndarray with shape (kh, kw) containing the kernel for
the convolution
kh is the height of the kernel
kw is the width of the kernel
padding is a tuple of (ph, pw)
ph is the padding for the height of the image
pw is the padding for the width of the image
the image should be padded with 0â€™s
You are only allowed to use two for loops; any other loops of any kind are
not allowed
Returns: a numpy.ndarray containing the convolved images
