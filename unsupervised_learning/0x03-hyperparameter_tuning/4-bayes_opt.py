4. Bayesian Optimization - Acquisition mandatory

Based on 3-bayes_opt.py, update the class BayesianOptimization:

    Public instance method def acquisition(self): that calculates the next best sample location:
        Uses the Expected Improvement acquisition function
        Returns: X_next, EI
            X_next is a numpy.ndarray of shape (1,) representing the next best sample point
            EI is a numpy.ndarray of shape (ac_samples,) containing the expected improvement of each potential sample
    You may use from scipy.stats import norm
